Hello! I am a Cybersecurity Researcher @ Idaho National Laboratory and ongoing doctoral candidate at Dakota State University. If you don't know me well, my main interests are malware analysis, reverse engineering, and - broadly speaking - cars (e.g. my [2006 Suzuki Grand Vitara XSport](images/suzuki.jpg)).

I have an orange tabby named, [Clover](images/clover.jpg). The #1 love of my life 🦁.

### Research Interest

See my publications for recent research or works. Currently, I'm considering my doctoral thesis topic; which, is anywhere from hardware re and the development of purposfully vulnerable firmware for serial devices, to improved malware analysis methods via NLP models and intermediary language representation gathering.

And I participated as a member of [DefSec](https://defsec.club/){:target="_blank"} @ DSU as well. As a part of the team for 2018 DOE CyberForce Competition, we placed fourth out of 70 teams nation-wide. [Team Photo](images/cyberforce.jpg).

I also competed at ISEAGE, another CCDC sort of competition. I forget what place we took. [Team Photo](images/ISEAGE.jpg).
