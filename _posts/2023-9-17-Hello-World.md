This site used to be a static page that displayed my resume, along with some current works. It still does that, see 'About', but I want to be more public and engage with people.

Everything I post won't be just my academic interests, but also personal ones; e.g., car stuff or home automation.

I might add comments in the future using Disquis, but we'll see ðŸ¤«
