title: Better Emojis ðŸ‘€
---

When I had a Mac Mini there was a really nice piece of software I used called, "Rocket". The way it worked was that you could type "::" and it would prompt an emoji selection window. You could type "::eyes" + ENTER and it would then insert the "ðŸ‘€" emoji where your cursor is. There isn't really any 1:to:1 option on Linux.

But, I recently came across this post from [hspn.in](https://hsps.in/post/amazing-emoji-keyboard-in-linux/) that talks about splatmoji. It works pretty similar, because you can launch the program using shortcuts controlled by your desktop environment. For me, this is KDE on Debian 12.

I created the shortcut by going into `Settings > Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts`.

Then select `Edit > New > Global Shortcut > Command/URL`.

Then add the command to be ran when triggered.

If you followed my example, you can now trigger the emoji selector with `CTRL+SHIFT+;`.

### Installation

If you haven't installed the program yet, it is pretty easy - just a few commands.

    sudo apt-get install xdotool rofi xsel
    wget https://github.com/cspeterson/splatmoji/releases/download/v1.2.0/splatmoji_1.2.0_all.deb
    sudo dpkg -i splatmoji_1.2.0_all.deb

And you can test the installation by running the cmd...

And that's it! ðŸ‘€
