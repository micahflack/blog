title: PrintShop - Serial Printer Environments and Security
---

I passed my dissertation proposal w/ minor revisions! My committee had some questions and feedback about my research proposal after the presentation. And, it was decided that one of the research questions (Q3) needed to have the scope reduced.

Here are the slides for my presentation:

* [Google Slides (with notes)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17u55JKb58PgyXVHVlkzWs0gGddnYHWVJMQRvcFLKx0c/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}
* [Slides PDF (without notes)](/docs/PrintShopSerialPrinterEnvironmentsSecurity.pdf){:target="_blank"}

And, the Github repo where I will be making my final revisions for the paper can be found here:

* [micahflack/DSU/.../CSC-809/DSU_Latex](https://github.com/micahflack/DSU/tree/master/CSC-809/DSU_Latex){:target="_blank"}
* Both of the *.bib files contain the Zotero bibliographies/references for my research

If you are in the beginning stages of writing your own dissertation proposal, or just thinking about learning Latex, I highly recommend the following setup:

* Zotero (citation manager)
* VSCode (LaTex editor)
* LaTex Workshop (extension for VSCode)
* Zotero LaTeX (extension for VSCode)
* Zotero: Better Bibtex (zotero extension)
* Github (version control)

I've talked to other students (now PhDs) who eventually had issues getting Overfleaf to fully build their PDFs at higher page ranges. Of course, you could pay for the premium version, which would fix the issue. But there are other options, so, you don't need to feel like you have to use Overleaf.

If you are interested in working on hardware reverse engineering projects, I also recommend these resources:

* The Hardware Hacking Handbook, ISBN-13: 9781593278748
* Open Circuits, ISBN-13: 9781718502345
